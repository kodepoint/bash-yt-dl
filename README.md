For some reason we need to download some videos from youtube. youtube-dl is open source tool to download youtube video. I did not explore the tool to see if it can download all videos that is saved in a text file. 

So quickly wrote a script to downloads video from different youtube links.


Usage:

./vdo-dl.sh "/path/to/save" "text.txt"
